# CnnForAndroid
##CnnForAndroid:A Vehicle Recognition Project using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in Android platform。

CnnForAndroid is a android platform's implementation of deep learning using Tiny-cnn structure and provide a Vehicle Recognition sample.

#Dependencies

[Opencv](http://opencv.org/)(for Android platform)

[Tiny-cnn](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn#features)

#For Vehicle Recogniton 

1.What is Vehicle Recognition?

 this project classify Car according to Car logo.Now  the lasting Version just distinguish VM car from other version.
 In the future I will add more category。

2.Where from Training Data ?

The major sources of our dataset include images captured by ourselves,Medialab LPR Dataset [1].
